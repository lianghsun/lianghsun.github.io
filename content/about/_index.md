# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ #

I am a passionate programmer, adept at intertwining web technologies, cybersecurity, networking, and deep learning concepts. I harbor a keen interest in technologies such as Python, Tensorflow, PHP (with a particular emphasis on Laravel), Penetration Testing, and more. Coding invigorates me, it's an exciting journey of discovery and innovation! 

Life continually astounds me, providing opportunities to delve into domains like deep learning and pharmaceutical studies, areas that were once completely foreign to me. My recent endeavors are concentrated on implementing deep learning in drug discovery pill using Tensorflow 2.x, and analyzing the properties of newly synthesized compounds with RDKit. I am exhilarated by the endless potential this field holds and look forward to contributing to its advancements.
